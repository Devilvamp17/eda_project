# EDA Report for Amount Prediction Dataset

## Dataset Overview
- Total entries: 11251
- Number of columns: 15
- Columns: User_ID, Cust_name, Product_ID, Gender, Age Group, Age, Marital_Status, State, Zone, Occupation, Product_Category, Orders, Amount, Status, unnamed1

## Null Value Summary
- Amount: 12 missing
- Status: 11251 missing (all values missing)
- unnamed1: 11251 missing (all values missing)

## Actions Taken
- Dropped columns: ['Status', 'unnamed1', 'User_ID']
- Dropped rows with missing 'Amount'

---

## Gender Distribution
- Female: 7832
- Male: 3407
- Majority of users are Female.

## Amount by Gender
- Total amount is higher for Female customers.
- Gender imbalance might influence prediction results.

---

## Correlation Analysis
- No strong correlation among numerical columns.
- Amount has negligible correlation with Age (0.03), Marital_Status (-0.02), Orders (-0.01)

---

## Zero Values in Numerical Columns
- Marital_Status has 6450 zero values (likely binary encoded)
- Other columns have no significant zero counts.

---

## Distributions Before Scaling
- **Age**: Skew = 1.19 (right-skewed), Kurtosis = 2.47 (peaked)
- **Marital_Status**: Skew = 0.32, Kurtosis = -1.90 (bimodal/binary)
- **Orders**: Skew = 0.02, Kurtosis = -1.35 (evenly spread categories)
- **Amount**: Skew = 0.56, Kurtosis = -0.54 (moderate positive skew)

---

## Scaling Strategy
- Applied StandardScaler for near-normal distributions
- Applied PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson) for moderate skew
- Applied RobustScaler for highly skewed distributions

## Post-scaling Checks
- All numerical distributions re-evaluated visually
- Skewness reduced for predictive modeling

---

## Categorical Encoding
- Applied Label Encoding for all object-type columns
- Columns transformed: Cust_name, Product_ID, Gender, Age Group, State, Zone, Occupation, Product_Category

---

## Feature Importance (RandomForest)
- Random Forest Regressor used to evaluate feature contributions
- Most important features for predicting 'Amount' visualized

---

## Final Observations
- 'Gender' and 'Product_Category' show impact on target variable
- Skewness and zero imbalance handled
- Data is prepared for regression modeling on 'Amount'
